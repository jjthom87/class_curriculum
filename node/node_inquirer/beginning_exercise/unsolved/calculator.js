/*

Make a calculator with node using process.argv:
	- process.argv[2] is an operator (i.e. 'add', 'subtract')
	- process.argv[3] & process.argv[4] will be numbers
	- based on what you put for process.argv[2], use that math to calculate
	  process.argv[3] & process.argv[4]...you can use a switch statement for this
	- make sure that numbers are entered for process.argv[3] & process.argv[4]
	- make sure that process.argv[2] is an appropriate operator,
	  use the default in the switch if it is not
