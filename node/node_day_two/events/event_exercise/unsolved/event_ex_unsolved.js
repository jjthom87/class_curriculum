/*

We're having a party and expecting guests! Implement a
doorbell event emitter with a greeter listener to greet them.
The event should take a command input with the new guest's name
and a command input with the guest's age, printing a friendly greeting.
Bonus: Try adding a second greeter, adding logic such that
one greeter only greets guests younger than 18, and the other
greets everyone else.

use process[2].argv for the "doorbell" command
use process[3].argv for the person's name
use process[4].argv for the person's age
